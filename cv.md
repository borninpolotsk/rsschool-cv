## Some Facts About Me
I’m a happy father of four-years old child. Prefer walking than driving, reading than watching and giving than receiving presents. Can’t imagine life without porridge in the morning, a cup
of coffee on the way to work and good music during the day. Wanna live in peace with my wife and spend holidays far from mother-in-law. My heart’s desire is to forget about daily routine
at home. Cat lover and dreamer. And also, I am a prudent person: always lose pens before they ran out of inks.

## Code Example
```
<p style="margin: 28.8pt 7.05pt 14.4pt 0px;">
 <span style="font-size: large; color: #6f489d;"><a name="FUSE_ID"></a>OPTICALLY VARIABLE IDENTIFICATION ELEMENT FUSE-ID</span>
</p>
<p>
	 A composite security feature with identification information about the document holder. FUSE-ID was developed by Giesecke&amp;Devrient company. It is printed with <a href="#OPTICALLY VARIABLE INK (OVI)">optically variable ink (OVI)</a> and laser engraved afterwards. The element is produced by a laser beam which moves sequentially over the image background area and leaves the image outline untouched. The laser energy discolors optically variable ink by changing its surface nanorelief and optical features. The image contrasts with the brightened background and looks darker. The image color is determined by <a href="#THIN-FILM INTERFERENCE">interference effect</a> which appears on the layered structure of ink pigments.
